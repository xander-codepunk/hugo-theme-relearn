      <description>Code Quality A new release can happen at any time from the main branch of the GitHub project without further accknowledgment. This makes it necessary that, every pushed set of changesets into the main branch must be self-contained and correct, resulting in a releasable version.&#xA;Stay simple for the user by focusing on the mantra &amp;ldquo;convention over configuration&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;At installation the site should work reasonable without (m)any configuration.&#xA;Stay close to the Hugo way.</description>

      <description>Semver This project tries to follow the semver policy - although not followed 100% in the past.&#xA;Usually an entry of Breaking on the What&amp;rsquo;s new page causes a new major release number.&#xA;All other entries on the What&amp;rsquo;s new page will increase the minor release number.&#xA;Releases resulting in a new major or minor number are called main release.&#xA;Releases containing bugixes only, are only increasing the patch release number.</description>
